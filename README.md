Built upon [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/tree/nnunetv1/), this repository provides the solution of Team IMR for [MICCAI 2024 CARE-LiQA Challenge](https://zmic.org.cn/care_2024/track3/). This repository contains the inference code to automatically segment the liver from single-phase MRI scan (LiSeg task) and predict liver fibrosis staging based on multi-phase and multi-center MRI scans (LiFS task).
